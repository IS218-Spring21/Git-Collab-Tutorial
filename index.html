                A git repository is the .git folder withing your project directory. It contains all of the modifications
                you've made in your project. It is the storing of this history that makes git such a powerful tool.
                Using this history we are able go back to previous version and save the current version while we make
                new changes so we don't overwrite anything or accidentally mess anything up. We can store our Git
                repositories locally on our machines or use online hosts like Github which take advantage of Git
                repositories to allow for collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can initialize an repo using <br><code>git init</code><br>
                We can add file to the repo for tracking using <br><code>git add &ltfile-name&gt</code><br>
            </p>

        <div class="col-xl-12">
            <p>
                Just as the name implies Clone (git clone) allows us to clone, or create a copy, of a repository. We can
                even clone parts of the repository while leaving other parts alone, we'll get to this in branching.
                We often use clone to grab a copy of a remote repository and put it onto our local machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                To clone a repo we use the following command <br><code>git clone &ltrepo-name&gt</code><br>

                Forking like cloning creates a copy of the repository in question.
                The important distinction being that cloning creates a copy on our local machine whereas a forking a
                repo will create a copy of that repo on your own github account.
            </p>
            <p>
                To fork a github repo go ahead and navigate to it and click the fork button on the top right side of the
                screen.

            <p>
                Branches in git allow us to work on parts of our code independently from others. For example, if you
                want to add a new feature while maintaining your current code you may want to create a new branch and
                add that feature there. Branches are often used to add in new features and are especially useful when
                used for collaboration
                through a remote repo. Each member of the team may create a new branch and add in their own unique
                features and then merge the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a new branch in your repo go ahead an use this command <br><code>git branch
                &ltbranch-name&gt</code><br>
            </p>

        <div class="col-xl-12">
            <p>
                We can imagine each branch as a line with many snapshots of our code that together create a detailed
                history of our project. It is these snapshots that allow us to move back in time to older code that we
                may saved. This process of saving and creating new snapshots is what is called committing. When we commit a change
                to our branch imagine a new snapshot popping onto that line of history. It also helps to leave message detailing what new changes were made in this commit so that we know what we are looking at if we look back
            </p>
            <p>
                The following command allows to create a commit within our git repo <br><code>git commit -m "&ltmessage
                detailing our work&gt"</code><br>

			<p>
				Having a branch for a new feature is a great and useful idea but at some point we want to combine it all especially before sending it out into the world. This is where the merge command comes in, merge allows us to put all of our branches together into a branch of our choosing. The merge command will merge the branch of our choosing to the branch we are currently on.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can merge branches using the following command <br><code>git merge &ltbranch-name&gt</code><br>

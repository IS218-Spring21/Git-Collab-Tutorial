                    <p>
                        GitFlow is at the very basic level a branching model by Vicent Driessen. According to Kumer, “git-flow are a set of git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's branching model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gitflow works best under environments that have schedule release cycles. Branches can be created for specific features, for upcoming releases, and even future releases all simultaneously.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    A Checkout is the process of switching between branches while using git. Atlsassian puts it as, “a
                    "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command
                    operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches. In addition to the definition of
                    "checkout" the phrase "checking out" is commonly used to imply the act of executing the git checkout
                    command.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, when using git, you are in the master branch. There must be an already existing branch in order
                        to execute the checkout command.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A new branch can be created by typing the following command:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> <code>git branch &ltexampleBranch&gt</code> </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Since exampleBranch exists we can switch into that branch. If exampleBranch did not exist we would have
                        gotten an error message
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A simple way to switch into a new branch without having an existing branch by using the following command
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> <code>git checkout -b &ltexampleBranch1&gt</code> </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Here, “git checkout -b” is the command and “exampleBranch1” is the new branch that we are creating. Since we
                        use “-b” this command creates a new branch and because of checkout we switch into that new branch
                        automatically.

                        Git push is a command that allows you to upload your local edited code to a remote repository. If you made
                        many commits, writing git push would upload and “push” your commits to the remote repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Git Push can be used as follows

                    <p>
                        &ltremote&gt being the remote repository
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &ltbranch&gt being the current branch you are on or the branch that you wish to upload to the remote
                        repository.

                    <p>
                        When starting a project locally you might have code in a remote repository. In order to retrieve that code, git pull downloads the code from the remote repository into your local files. Git pull is the opposite of git push.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Git pull can be used as follows
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <p>
                        We mentioned pushing and pulling from a remote repository. In order to tell Git which repository we want to pull or push from we need to tell git by using the git remote add command.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>git remote add &ltname&gt &lturl&gt</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        &ltname&gt is the name you choose to name the remote repository. By default, many people name the remote repository as “origin”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &lturl&gt is the url of the remote repository. It is an https link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since we are able to add repositories we can also remove them. This can be done as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>git remote remove &ltname&gt</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Where &ltname&gt is the name you assigned to the remote repository when adding it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we were to forget what we named the remote repository we are pushing or pulling from we use the following command.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>git remote show</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If we name the remote repository “origin” then, this command would output origin.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If we wanted to know the url of the remote repository, then a similar command would be needed.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>git remote -v</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This command would display the remote url.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Git status is a command that allows you to see the status of your current branch. Since the last commit was made, any new changes would appear when this command is typed. Git status also displays the branch you are currently working on. The following image shows what the “git status” command displays.
